# Custom Mouse

This project is a custom-designed computer mouse made using a Raspberry Pi Pico board and a fully 3D-printed shell.  
All parts of the mouse — including the shell, buttons, and scroll wheel — were modeled, printed, and assembled manually.  
The PCB and schematic were designed to fit perfectly inside the case.
